### Exercise 1: ByteBuffer Basics

**Time Estimate:** 15 minutes

**Description:** Create a Java program that demonstrates basic usage of `ByteBuffer`. You'll initialize a `ByteBuffer`, put and retrieve different data types (e.g., int, char, double) into/from it, and print the data to the console.

**Guidelines:**

1. Create a `ByteBuffer` with a capacity of 32 bytes.

2. Put an integer, a character, a double, and a string into the buffer using appropriate `put` methods.

3. Flip the buffer to prepare it for reading.

4. Retrieve and print the data from the buffer.
